Use Case: AI-Driven Supplier Communication & Document Exchange

I want to build a minimal AI Agentic PoC that enables me to keep improving on components within it to increase accuracy of each module over time.

I want it to be a memory first approach that tracks conversations and document information across supplier keys, so that it enables the AI Agent to keep conversations active across different suppliers.

My tech stack:
I am using Supabase as my database
I am using mem0, langchain for the AI Agent executions planning
I am reading pdfs and cached databases of pdf summaries (generated by passing openai over each image and summarising it properly), this is to enable the searching and retrieval of relevant documentation. The key of this cached database would be supplier wise for supplier specific data and internal documentation table for internal documents necessary for the conversations.


Before writing code, I want you to think about the profiling of the app, what the overall modules I will need to develop are, each module's purpose and how the flow of supplier communication will work. How and when it will be triggered (2-3 possible triggers) and how the agent will maintain conversations (when it should pause, when it should read up data from the supplier specific cached db and the internal documents cached db).

The frontend should also show a dashboard tracking each supplier, the conversation trace , and helps us navigate to the documents stored and for upload for each supplier and for the internal documents db.


And finally, for the minimal PoC - how to plug in LLM as a judge evaluators across the main agentic processes. Think about how this would be implemented since this is important for the PoC from the ideation perspective - so do the scoping from an evaluation first perspective.

AI-DRIVEN SUPPLIER COMMUNICATION & DOCUMENT EXCHANGE – MINIMAL POC DESIGN
────────────────────────

0.  Guiding Principles  
    • “Memory-first”: every atomic event (message, file, task, judgment) is stored once and indexed immediately.  
    • Evaluation-first: every important agent output is auto-scored by an LLM judge before it is considered “final”.  
    • Replaceable modules: start small, swap-in better models or retrieval strategies later without touching the orchestration layer.

2. MODULE DETAILS
────────────────────────
2.1  Ingestion / Indexing  
     Purpose: Convert any supplier or internal file / message into structured, retrievable data.

     Sub-components  
     • File Watcher: listens for new PDFs uploaded via dashboard or e-mail dropbox.  
     • PDF → Text/OCR → Chunker → Summariser (OpenAI function call).  
     • Embeddings Generator (OpenAI, Supabase vector store).  
     • Metadata Enricher: supplier_id, doc_type, version, date.  
     • Store raw text + summary + embedding row → supabase.public.documents.  

2.2  Memory & Retrieval  
     • Long-term vector memory: Supabase vector store, keyed by supplier_id or “internal”.  
     • Episodic conversation memory: mem0 conversation objects (chronological jsonl).  
     • Short-term scratchpad: passed to model as LangChain buffer window.  
     • Retrieval API: supplier_scoped(search_query, k) → {chunks, citations}.  

2.3  Agent Orchestrator  
     Stack: LangChain ReAct or Plan-and-Execute + mem0 MemoryRetriever.

     a. Conversation Manager  
        Maintains conversation state: OPEN, WAITING_FOR_SUPPLIER, WAITING_INTERNAL, CLOSED.  
        Decides when to “pause” (set state WAITING) and resume (trigger fires).

     b. Skill / Tool set  
        • doc_search(tool_input)  
        • write_response(draft)  
        • ask_internal(question)  
        • schedule_followup(days)  
        Each tool logs its arguments & result to mem0.

     c. Planning loop  
        1. Receive trigger → load conversation summary + last N turns.  
        2. LLM planner proposes next action sequence.  
        3. Execute tools sequentially.  
        4. Draft outbound message.  
        5. Send to Evaluation module.

2.4  Evaluation / Guardrail  
     For PoC, a single OpenAI GPT-4 judge prompt scored 1-10 on:  
     • Factual accuracy vs cited docs  
     • Relevance to supplier query  
     • Tone & compliance (polite, no leakage).  
     If score ≥ threshold – auto-send. Else flag for human revision (manual override from dashboard).  
     Logs: score, reasoning, reference ids → supabase.evaluations.

2.5  Trigger & Scheduler (three initial triggers)  
     1. Inbound supplier e-mail / chat webhook.  
     2. Manual “New conversation” button on dashboard.  
     3. Cron job (daily) scanning conversations in WAITING_FOR_SUPPLIER > X days → nudge.

2.6  Frontend Dashboard (Next.js + Supabase auth)  
     1. Supplier list view: status badge, last contact, evaluation average.  
     2. Conversation thread view: left (supplier/agent messages), right (citations + eval scores).  
     3. Document tab per supplier & global internal docs: upload, search, preview.  
     4. Admin panel: thresholds, enable/disable auto-send.

────────────────────────
3. END-TO-END FLOW
────────────────────────
1) Supplier mails a spec change → inbound webhook → Trigger(1).  
2) Conversation Manager loads memory; Planner decides:  
   a) Search supplier_docs for “spec change pdf v3”.  
   b) Search internal_docs for “pricing policy”.  
   c) Compose answer + attach citations.  
3) Draft sent to Evaluation module.  
   • Judge says: “Accuracy: 9, Relevance: 8, Tone: 9 → pass”.  
4) Message auto-sent; conversation state = WAITING_FOR_SUPPLIER.  
5) All artefacts stored; dashboard updates in real time.

────────────────────────
4. LLM-AS-A-JUDGE IMPLEMENTATION (POC SCOPE)
────────────────────────
Tables  
• evaluations(id, conv_id, turn_id, judge_prompt_version, scores_json, comments, created_at)

Workflow  
• After every generated outbound_draft → call evaluate(draft, relevant_chunks).  
• Prompt template includes: system guidelines, supplier question, draft answer, citations text.  
• Parse JSON scores (use OpenAI function calling) → if any dimension < min_threshold, label “FAIL”.  
• FAILED drafts appear highlighted red in dashboard → human must edit/approve.

Cost control: start with GPT-3.5-turbo for relevance, run GPT-4 only on high-impact messages (value > X, doc count > Y).

────────────────────────
5. MINIMAL POC CHECKLIST
────────────────────────
[ ] Supabase schema (documents, conversations, messages, evaluations, suppliers).  
[ ] PDF ingestion Lambda/Edge function with summariser + embedding insert.  
[ ] Basic LangChain agent with 2 tools (doc_search, write_response) + mem0 memory.  
[ ] Evaluation call + threshold logic.  
[ ] Simple dashboard pages (list, thread, upload).  
Deliverable: handle 1 supplier, 1 internal policy doc, show evaluation pipeline end-to-end.

────────────────────────
6. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
────────────────────────
• Fine-tuned embeddings per domain.  
• Multi-agent role separation (Planner, Researcher, Writer).  
• RLHF on evaluation scores.  
• Active learning loop: failed evaluations feed back into retraining summariser.  
• Supplier portal for two-way file upload (signed URLs).

────────────────────────
This design keeps each concern isolated, lets you swap in better retrieval, planning or judging components, and—because it is “evaluation-first”—you will have immediate quantitative feedback on every iteration of the system.
